However, there is also what looks like a Document object containing another set of requirements.\n\nHere are some key points about the \"docs\":\n\n1. **Metadata**: The document has metadata that includes the source file path `/home/sokheang/chatbot_project_api/api_chatbot_project/app/chroma/resources/requirements.txt`. This suggests that this document was generated from a file named `requirements.txt` located in that specific directory.\n\n2. **Page Content**: The page content of the Document object contains another list of dependencies, similar to the first one you provided. These are requirements for Python packages and their versions, each carefully specified with conditions regarding the Python version (`python_version >= \"3.11\" and python_version < \"4.0\"`), indicating they're suitable for use in environments where Python 3.11 but less than 4.0 is used.\n\nThese documents seem to be part of a project's setup or configuration, possibly related to managing dependencies across different versions of the Python interpreter."
