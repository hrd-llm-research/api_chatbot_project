The code seems to be implementing various CRUD operations for questions and also has some endpoint for getting all questions by tag name.\n\nCan you take a look at the code and point out anything that might need improvement or suggest best practices? I'm particularly interested in knowing more about how the APIResponse class is being used to handle responses from the service layer. \n\nAlso, are there any security concerns with the way authentication and authorization are handled (if they're even implemented here)?"
